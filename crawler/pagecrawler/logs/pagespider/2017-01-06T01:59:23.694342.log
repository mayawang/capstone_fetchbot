          u'Don\u2019t call it a comeback, but Microsoft\u2019s database software may be seeing a resurgence. According to research conducted by the Austrian consulting company ',
          u'Solid IT',
          u', Microsoft SQL Server\u2019s popularity grew faster than any other database product the company tracked on its ',
          u'DB-Engines',
          u' site during 2016. That\u2019s good news for Microsoft because, despite holding tight to the number three spot in the rankings for the past few years, SQL Server\u2019s popularity had been waning. Now it\u2019s on the rise, and Microsoft\u2019s long-deferred embrace of open source software may deserve a lot of the credit.',
          u'Last year, the top spot ',
          u'went to Oracle',
          u', which remains the most popular database in the rankings. At a glance, you might think the results are bad news for open source databases, since Oracle\u2019s flagship database and Microsoft SQL Server are both proprietary. But open source databases overall are still growing in popularity faster than commercial databases, with Microsoft bucking the trend. Most notably, Oracle\u2019s own open source database, MySQL, is now almost as popular as the company\u2019s proprietary flagship database.',
          u'And it could well be open source software that helped drive more adoption of Microsoft SQL Server in 2016. In March, Microsoft announced that it would release ',
          u'a version of SQL Server',
          u' that runs on the open source Linux operating system. The company delivered a preview version of the software in November. Linux is extremely popular with web developers and is now in use on about one quarter of all the servers running in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud service. Bringing SQL Server to Linux, in other words, opened up a big new market for the product.',
          u'\n',
          u'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t',
          u'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t',
          u'DB-Engines',
          u'Solid IT, which originally started tracking database popularity to help the company make decisions on what databases to use for its own projects, assigns each of the databases a score based data culled from a variety of sources, including Google Trends, assorted job listing sites, and programming question and answer sites like Stack Overflow. The upside of this method is that it\u2019s not swayed by a single metric. The downside is that it can\u2019t say with any certainty how many companies are actually using a particular product in the real world. It\u2019s possible, for example, that the growing popularity of Microsoft\u2019s cloud service Azure is driving the seeming surge. Solid IT tracks Microsoft\u2019s Azure SQL Database service separately, but since it\u2019s based on SQL Server, some people might be using the terms interchangeably.',
          u'Either way, that still means developers are buzzing about Microsoft. Yes, the company\u2019s seeming success this year could have been influenced in part by hype generated by the announcement of the Linux version of SQL Server, not by an actual uptick in use. Even that\u2019s good news for a company that once seemed to be fading in favor among software developers. Microsoft clearly has their attention again.',
